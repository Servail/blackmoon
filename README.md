# Black Moon
![Preview](https://i.imgur.com/c8T1EnC.png)

Black minimalistic theme for Pale Moon, based on [Dark Moon](https://github.com/Lootyhoof/darkmoon).
No colors, no round corners, almost no light. Extremely compact and easy on eyes. Very useful with linear gamma.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
You can grab the latest release from the Releases section of this repository, or base theme from the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/themes/complete/darkmoon/).
